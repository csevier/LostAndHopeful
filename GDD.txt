At its core Lost and Hopeful is a multiplayer hide and go seek game.

Setting:
Island for players to run around. Big enough to be for for about 2-5 ppl.
- Ruins?
- Pipes for teleport


Gameplay:
Zombie style hide and go seek. Designated seekers "The Hopefilled" use the hope bursting out of their eyes to find "The Lost". 
Once a lost is captured they become Hopefilled and seek out friendship.

Hopefilled objective is to capture the lost and make friends with them.
The lost objective is to stay unfound for as long as possible.
 - Sub objective is to capture the recluse orbs. (The lost want to stay lost.). When a lost captures a recluse orb it gives the the power of
   annoyance to ward away friends with obnoxuous sounds and lights on their hat. The annoyance skill increases the more orbs are found.
 - Sound gets louder more lights get added to hat and have brighter lumens and distance.
 - The lost maybe get point based on how long they keep their hat on multiplied by their recluse orbs.
   - See this is the joke because the lost are actually begging to be found and have friends too. Oh yeah, psychology. 

Game ends when all are friends by finding all lost.

Loop resets and picks another hopefilled.
